# Bike Tour Maps

I've made a variety of maps of my bike travels but most of them are just overlays on OSM basemaps. No fun.

My plan here is to hack together a method to plot a GPX track onto the maps produced by the Python library `ridge-map`.

# GPX Data

The data is pulled from Strava's REST API and ran through the processing pipeline that was needed for a [map I made for class](https://github.com/afong3/bikeviz/tree/main).
